# myTextEditor
This an TRULY-OpenSourced Text Editor. 
The code has been writen in C++. 
By this time is just a prove of concept. 
It will be CLI. GUI will be deployed in a very long future, its not the main thing. 
Is crossplatform compilable through Linux and Windows. 

!! IMPORTANT !!
By this time there is no highlighting nor fonts.

Input:
Use ctrl + s to save.
Use esc to finish the program.
Use f9 to compile using g++ (WIP).


WIP:
Menu is being developed.
Highliting is being trated but due to de diferences between Windows and Linux terminals will be finished as a onlyLinux featured by this time.
Auto-completation will be developed after Menu.
Auto-save is planted to be finished next week.
More options will be added, like new file, save a copy or moving though the file using the direcction arrow

Welp... English is not my first languaje, so please be patient with my bad english. Also some help to translate the docs will be great.

Also, this is project can be distrubuted, copied, and modified as you like, but I prey you that if some modifications were made 
please upload them to this repository, or let me know what you have changed.

THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME!!
